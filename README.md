# Restaurant-Ordering-App
A simple restaurant ordering web app that displays a menu, allows users to add or remove items from their order, shows real-time total pricing, and includes a mock payment form. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES modules), it demonstrates UI rendering, event delegation, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
